# CNN-model
1. Implemented a Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) using TensorFlow and Keras in Python for image classification tasks, achieving high accuracy in distinguishing between dogs and cats.
2. Conducted extensive data preprocessing, including image augmentation techniques such as rescaling, shearing, zooming, and horizontal flipping, to enhance model performance and robustness.
3. Utilized transfer learning by leveraging pre-trained CNN architectures and fine-tuning them on custom datasets, resulting in efficient training and improved classification accuracy for identifying animals in images.
